# phpenv cookbook

Installs [phpenv](https://github.com/phpenv/phpenv) php version manager
application and build php from source for production environments.

The cookbook provides LWRPs to easily build new php versions.

# Requirements

The cookbook was tested on ubuntu server 12.04 and may not works on other systems.

Requires Chef 10.16.4 or later.


# Usage

Add the `default`recipe to your run list:

    { "run_list": ["recipe[phpenv]"] }

# Attributes

By default phpenv will be installed into `/opt/phpenv` directory and can be used
by every user but only `root` can build a new php version and set the global php
version.

You can build different php versions  just like specifying e.g. the following
attributes:

    "phpenv": {
      "phps": [
        {
          "release": "5.3.25",
          "environment": { "LDFLAGS": "-lstdc++" }
        },
        "5.4.15"
      ],
      "global": "5.4.15"
    }

See [`attributes/default.rb`](attributes/default.rb) for more information.
